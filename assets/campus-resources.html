                    <p>
                        As a Residence Assistant, I am "live-in" mentor and supervisor for 60+ first year engineering students.
                        I would get information from Residence Life Management to relay to students, and also served as a mentor to
                        learn about my students. I wanted to figure out the best way to support my students to learn and grow
                        as well as keep them updated with relevant information.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Problem</h2>

                    <h3> 
                        1. Sending information & Student engagement
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        I received several weekly updates from Residence Life Management to relay to students, but
                        if I sent weekly e-mails, the frequency would lead to lower student engagement and my
                        e-mails containing pertinent information would get ignored.
                    </p>

                    <h3> 
                        2. Helping my students grow and develop as they want to
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        I wanted to support my students in developing themselves and feeling comfortable in residence,
                        but I didn't know what was important to them.

                        2. Surveys<br><br>

                        One on ones were conducted to understand my user's stories, needs, motivations, and struggles.
                        By empathising with my users, I was able to get a grasp on what was important to them
                        and what they needed. The survey provided data which supported the insights made from my one on ones.
